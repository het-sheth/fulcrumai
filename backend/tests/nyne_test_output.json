My first Skype call during a student exchange with peers in Europe revealed the power of technology to connect people and ignite curiosity. From my hometown of Mumbai, each step on this journey has deepened my exploration of technology's potential.\n\nAs a computer science student and software developer at Penn State University, I leverage technology to drive progress and create meaningful impact. I am proficient in various programming languages, including the MERN stack, Java, Python, C, C++, and JavaScript, which enables me to engage in diverse software development projects. \n\nMy leadership and mentorship skills involve guiding peers and fostering their growth through effective mentoring. Additionally, I focus on community building by supporting international students and helping them integrate into university life. \n\nI'm currently exploring the intricacies of data structures and algorithms through hands-on experience with C and C++, further solidifying my foundation in computer science\n\nI love meeting new people and learning about new perspectives. I aim to be a leading software developer and innovator, creating solutions that transform industries and improve lives. I\u2019m eager to explore emerging technologies and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\n\nI\u2019d love to connect with fellow professionals and innovators. Let\u2019s connect on LinkedIn to share insights, discuss emerging technologies, and explore opportunities for collaboration.",

My first Skype call during a student exchange with peers in Europe revealed the power of technology to connect people and ignite curiosity. From my hometown of Mumbai, each step on this journey has deepened my exploration of technology's potential.\n\nAs a computer science student and software developer at Penn State University, I leverage technology to drive progress and create meaningful impact. I am proficient in various programming languages, including the MERN stack, Java, Python, C, C++, and JavaScript, which enables me to engage in diverse software development projects. \n\nMy leadership and mentorship skills involve guiding peers and fostering their growth through effective mentoring. Additionally, I focus on community building by supporting international students and helping them integrate into university life. \n\nI'm currently exploring the intricacies of data structures and algorithms through hands-on experience with C and C++, further solidifying my foundation in computer science\n\nI love meeting new people and learning about new perspectives. I aim to be a leading software developer and innovator, creating solutions that transform industries and improve lives. I\u2019m eager to explore emerging technologies and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\n\nI\u2019d love to connect with fellow professionals and innovators.

I am proficient in various programming languages, including the MERN stack, Java, Python, C, C++, and JavaScript, which enables me to engage in diverse software development projects. \n\nMy leadership and mentorship skills involve guiding peers and fostering their growth through effective mentoring. Additionally, I focus on community building by supporting international students and helping them integrate into university life. \n\nI'm currently exploring the intricacies of data structures and algorithms through hands-on experience with C and C++, further solidifying my foundation in computer science\n\nI love meeting new people and learning about new perspectives. I aim to be a leading software developer and innovator, creating solutions that transform industries and improve lives. I\u2019m eager to explore emerging technologies and push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.\n\nI\u2019d love to connect with fellow professionals and innovators.
