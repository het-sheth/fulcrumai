We are on a mission to make using the public cloud utterly seamless.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank our users, investors, and most importantly, the Porter team. As all of them know, we are only getting started.\n\nWe\u2019re actively hiring with offices in NY and SF, so if you\u2019re interested in managing core infrastructure for the next generation of public companies or tackling the hardest devX problems, shoot me a DM.",

Within two weeks, hundreds of people were using it in underwriting, maritime law, logistics, oil and gas, crypto, sales and marketing and much more.\n\nToday, we're launching the next version with 20 AI experts across 16 industries to help you carry out deep research and get serious work done.\n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude06 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf2'\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddef\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddda\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\nMost people are still stuck with AI that doesn't help them get work done. Chatbots that aren't specialized in their domain or vertical agents built for 2024's models\u2014rigid workflows that break easily. \n\nMeanwhile, software engineers using Claude Code or Cursor are shipping 10x faster because those tools figured out what actually works. Modern coding agents load up the right context. Then get to work on your objective. \n\nThat's what Grep does too. You give it an objective\u2014\"research this company to verify it is legitimate,\" \"analyze this market and identify potential leads,\" \"tell me who previously owned this vessel,\" \"evaluate this vendor's compliance risk,\" \"Carry out a background check on this employee.\" Grep picks the right Expert and starts investigating across 50+ specialized sources, including corporate registries, court records, financial filings, sanctions databases, shipping data, academic journals and much more. This deep research provides the context to help you complete your task.\n\nThen you dig deeper. Ask follow-ups. Probe specific angles. The expert already has all the skills and integrations to help you get work done.\n\nBut work doesn't end with research. Grep helps you turn that research into docs, decks, slides, reports, and even code. The context carries through, so the AI Expert can help you execute, not just inform.\n\nWe're pretty excited about Grep and would love your feedback, especially if you are an early adopter of AI in your domain but aren't satisfied with your existing workflows.\n\nIf you want to try it, join the waitlist at grep.ai - we'll be starting with a small group of beta users and expanding as our AI Experts get better.\n\nP.S.

      "content": "Eclipse is proud to be leading Jetson's $50M Series A, partnering with Stephen Lake, Aaron Grant and Matthew Bailey, to deliver the electric home of the future. \n\nJetson is on a mission to power the entire home more efficiently, affordably, and cleanly by reinventing the products and process by which energy infrastructure is installed, financed, serviced, and managed. Starting with heat pumps (the core energy-consuming infrastructure of the home that accounts for $300B in annual consumer spend), Jetson is building a vertically integrated, software-driven home energy ecosystem. \n\nThis approach is a complete departure from the fragmented, largely manual home energy industry that exists\u00a0today. Jetson isn't just delivering the economic and environmental benefits of electricity; it's transforming the customer experience. They believe every homeowner deserves an Apple-level experience for critical home infrastructure service, from quote, to install, to operations \u2014 and with up to 50% lower cost. A little more than a year after launching, the company is already in more than 1,000 homes across the U.S. and Canada. This is after a breakout 2025 with over 10x growth and a 75 Net-Promoter-Score. \n\nBeyond the incredible execution and massive opportunity, Jetson hits home personally for me, for 3 big reasons. \n\nFirst, as a fellow University of Waterloo \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Engineer, I\u2019ve seen Stephen, Aaron, and Matthew execute on trailblazing full-stack products for over a decade. They\u2019re an immensely talented, focused, and grounded team who has irreplaceable chemistry and taste.\n\nSecond, from my time founding Kojo and investing in the built environment, I've seen firsthand that the existing value chain of installers, suppliers and manufacturers can only gain so much efficiency with new tech. The Jetson team is working from first-principles and owning everything from the hardware, firmware, consumer facing software, all the way to the crews, trucks and warehouse operations. This end-to-end control allows them to deliver a best-in-class product experience, while also shortening the value chain and passing significant cost savings to the customers.\n\nFinally, in addition to this great team and opportunity, we\u2019re investing alongside some of our favorite people. Alex Kolicich (8VC), Eric Meyer, Caroline C. (Activate Capital), Mike McCauley (Garage Capital), Mike Winterfield (Active Impact Investments) and Garry Tan.\n\nRead all about the investment here: https://lnkd.in/g4MZJS5j\n\nRead Sean Silcoff's coverage in the Globe and Mail: https://lnkd.in/gmGzPx54 \n\nJiten Behl, Michael Laser, Charly M., Lior Susan, Aidan Madigan-Curtis, Greg Reichow, Seth Winterroth, Kaitlyn Glancy, Greg Lyon, Angela Hayward, Laura Spaventa Lewis, Heather Mack, Mary Wells",

And the story gets even better...\n\nI'm excited to announce we've raised a $70M Series B from Khosla Ventures & SoftBank Investment Advisers, with Lightspeed India, Prosus Ventures, Together & Y Combinator participating.\n\nThis matters a lot to me personally. I've watched hundreds of people, including most friends, give up great ideas prematurely because building software felt impossible.\n\nWhen Madhav and I started Emergent, we wanted to give everyone a team of top 1% developers to bring their most audacious ideas to life.\n\nThis raise gets us closer to that ambition. Now, we help builders all over the world do the same.\n\nMillions need to know the time has come to transform their businesses and lives through software. Millions more haven't even realized that it's never been easier to build.\n\nIt's time to take Emergent there.\n\nThe next era of entrepreneurship won't be built with expensive engineers or high dev shop costs. It will be built with Emergent.\n\nWe're the only AI app builder that operates like a team of top engineers, turning ideas into monetizable software.\n\nThe expression of ideas is universally distributed. We only have one ask: Can you describe and express your idea?\n\nThe world is ready for your next big idea to take shape.\n\nStart building now: https://lnkd.in/g8zsavDA\n\n#aicoding #aistartup #startupfunding #vibecoding",

We are on a mission to make using the public cloud utterly seamless.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank our users, investors, and most importantly, the Porter team. As all of them know, we are only getting started.\n\nWe\u2019re actively hiring with offices in NY and SF, so if you\u2019re interested in managing core infrastructure for the next generation of public companies or tackling the hardest devX problems, shoot me a DM.",

Within two weeks, hundreds of people were using it in underwriting, maritime law, logistics, oil and gas, crypto, sales and marketing and much more.\n\nToday, we're launching the next version with 20 AI experts across 16 industries to help you carry out deep research and get serious work done.\n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude06 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf2'\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddef\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddda\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\nMost people are still stuck with AI that doesn't help them get work done. Chatbots that aren't specialized in their domain or vertical agents built for 2024's models\u2014rigid workflows that break easily. \n\nMeanwhile, software engineers using Claude Code or Cursor are shipping 10x faster because those tools figured out what actually works. Modern coding agents load up the right context. Then get to work on your objective. \n\nThat's what Grep does too. You give it an objective\u2014\"research this company to verify it is legitimate,\" \"analyze this market and identify potential leads,\" \"tell me who previously owned this vessel,\" \"evaluate this vendor's compliance risk,\" \"Carry out a background check on this employee.\" Grep picks the right Expert and starts investigating across 50+ specialized sources, including corporate registries, court records, financial filings, sanctions databases, shipping data, academic journals and much more. This deep research provides the context to help you complete your task.\n\nThen you dig deeper. Ask follow-ups. Probe specific angles. The expert already has all the skills and integrations to help you get work done.\n\nBut work doesn't end with research. Grep helps you turn that research into docs, decks, slides, reports, and even code. The context carries through, so the AI Expert can help you execute, not just inform.\n\nWe're pretty excited about Grep and would love your feedback, especially if you are an early adopter of AI in your domain but aren't satisfied with your existing workflows.\n\nIf you want to try it, join the waitlist at grep.ai - we'll be starting with a small group of beta users and expanding as our AI Experts get better.\n\nP.S.

          "content": "Eclipse is proud to be leading Jetson's $50M Series A, partnering with Stephen Lake, Aaron Grant and Matthew Bailey, to deliver the electric home of the future. \n\nJetson is on a mission to power the entire home more efficiently, affordably, and cleanly by reinventing the products and process by which energy infrastructure is installed, financed, serviced, and managed. Starting with heat pumps (the core energy-consuming infrastructure of the home that accounts for $300B in annual consumer spend), Jetson is building a vertically integrated, software-driven home energy ecosystem. \n\nThis approach is a complete departure from the fragmented, largely manual home energy industry that exists\u00a0today. Jetson isn't just delivering the economic and environmental benefits of electricity; it's transforming the customer experience. They believe every homeowner deserves an Apple-level experience for critical home infrastructure service, from quote, to install, to operations \u2014 and with up to 50% lower cost. A little more than a year after launching, the company is already in more than 1,000 homes across the U.S. and Canada. This is after a breakout 2025 with over 10x growth and a 75 Net-Promoter-Score. \n\nBeyond the incredible execution and massive opportunity, Jetson hits home personally for me, for 3 big reasons. \n\nFirst, as a fellow University of Waterloo \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Engineer, I\u2019ve seen Stephen, Aaron, and Matthew execute on trailblazing full-stack products for over a decade. They\u2019re an immensely talented, focused, and grounded team who has irreplaceable chemistry and taste.\n\nSecond, from my time founding Kojo and investing in the built environment, I've seen firsthand that the existing value chain of installers, suppliers and manufacturers can only gain so much efficiency with new tech. The Jetson team is working from first-principles and owning everything from the hardware, firmware, consumer facing software, all the way to the crews, trucks and warehouse operations. This end-to-end control allows them to deliver a best-in-class product experience, while also shortening the value chain and passing significant cost savings to the customers.\n\nFinally, in addition to this great team and opportunity, we\u2019re investing alongside some of our favorite people. Alex Kolicich (8VC), Eric Meyer, Caroline C. (Activate Capital), Mike McCauley (Garage Capital), Mike Winterfield (Active Impact Investments) and Garry Tan.\n\nRead all about the investment here: https://lnkd.in/g4MZJS5j\n\nRead Sean Silcoff's coverage in the Globe and Mail: https://lnkd.in/gmGzPx54 \n\nJiten Behl, Michael Laser, Charly M., Lior Susan, Aidan Madigan-Curtis, Greg Reichow, Seth Winterroth, Kaitlyn Glancy, Greg Lyon, Angela Hayward, Laura Spaventa Lewis, Heather Mack, Mary Wells",

          "content": "$50M ARR. 5M+ users in 190+ countries. Emergent is now one of the fastest growing AI startups in the world. The fastest-ever in India. And the story gets even better...\n\nI'm excited to announce we've raised a $70M Series B from Khosla Ventures & SoftBank Investment Advisers, with Lightspeed India, Prosus Ventures, Together & Y Combinator participating.\n\nThis matters a lot to me personally. I've watched hundreds of people, including most friends, give up great ideas prematurely because building software felt impossible.\n\nWhen Madhav and I started Emergent, we wanted to give everyone a team of top 1% developers to bring their most audacious ideas to life.\n\nThis raise gets us closer to that ambition. Now, we help builders all over the world do the same.\n\nMillions need to know the time has come to transform their businesses and lives through software. Millions more haven't even realized that it's never been easier to build.\n\nIt's time to take Emergent there.\n\nThe next era of entrepreneurship won't be built with expensive engineers or high dev shop costs. It will be built with Emergent.\n\nWe're the only AI app builder that operates like a team of top engineers, turning ideas into monetizable software.\n\nThe expression of ideas is universally distributed. We only have one ask: Can you describe and express your idea?\n\nThe world is ready for your next big idea to take shape.\n\nStart building now: https://lnkd.in/g8zsavDA\n\n#aicoding #aistartup #startupfunding #vibecoding",

I designed and shipped major parts of the app including text processing, post editor, customizable blog theme engine, embed expansion, realtime and digest email notifications and subscriptions, and bookmarklet. \n\nVaryingly over the years I had to wear all the other hats too -- tech architecture, scaling and optimization, customer support, spam and abuse eradication, branding, PR. It was a blast.\n\nLaunched in July of 2008 and at peak was a Quantcast Top 200 site. We grew 10x in 2009 and 2.5x in 2010.

We are on a mission to make using the public cloud utterly seamless.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank our users, investors, and most importantly, the Porter team. As all of them know, we are only getting started.\n\nWe\u2019re actively hiring with offices in NY and SF, so if you\u2019re interested in managing core infrastructure for the next generation of public companies or tackling the hardest devX problems, shoot me a DM.",

Within two weeks, hundreds of people were using it in underwriting, maritime law, logistics, oil and gas, crypto, sales and marketing and much more.\n\nToday, we're launching the next version with 20 AI experts across 16 industries to help you carry out deep research and get serious work done.\n\n\ud835\uddea\ud835\uddf5\ud835\ude06 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf2'\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddef\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddda\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\nMost people are still stuck with AI that doesn't help them get work done. Chatbots that aren't specialized in their domain or vertical agents built for 2024's models\u2014rigid workflows that break easily. \n\nMeanwhile, software engineers using Claude Code or Cursor are shipping 10x faster because those tools figured out what actually works. Modern coding agents load up the right context. Then get to work on your objective. \n\nThat's what Grep does too. You give it an objective\u2014\"research this company to verify it is legitimate,\" \"analyze this market and identify potential leads,\" \"tell me who previously owned this vessel,\" \"evaluate this vendor's compliance risk,\" \"Carry out a background check on this employee.\" Grep picks the right Expert and starts investigating across 50+ specialized sources, including corporate registries, court records, financial filings, sanctions databases, shipping data, academic journals and much more. This deep research provides the context to help you complete your task.\n\nThen you dig deeper. Ask follow-ups. Probe specific angles. The expert already has all the skills and integrations to help you get work done.\n\nBut work doesn't end with research. Grep helps you turn that research into docs, decks, slides, reports, and even code. The context carries through, so the AI Expert can help you execute, not just inform.\n\nWe're pretty excited about Grep and would love your feedback, especially if you are an early adopter of AI in your domain but aren't satisfied with your existing workflows.\n\nIf you want to try it, join the waitlist at grep.ai - we'll be starting with a small group of beta users and expanding as our AI Experts get better.\n\nP.S.

        "content": "Eclipse is proud to be leading Jetson's $50M Series A, partnering with Stephen Lake, Aaron Grant and Matthew Bailey, to deliver the electric home of the future. \n\nJetson is on a mission to power the entire home more efficiently, affordably, and cleanly by reinventing the products and process by which energy infrastructure is installed, financed, serviced, and managed. Starting with heat pumps (the core energy-consuming infrastructure of the home that accounts for $300B in annual consumer spend), Jetson is building a vertically integrated, software-driven home energy ecosystem. \n\nThis approach is a complete departure from the fragmented, largely manual home energy industry that exists\u00a0today. Jetson isn't just delivering the economic and environmental benefits of electricity; it's transforming the customer experience. They believe every homeowner deserves an Apple-level experience for critical home infrastructure service, from quote, to install, to operations \u2014 and with up to 50% lower cost. A little more than a year after launching, the company is already in more than 1,000 homes across the U.S. and Canada. This is after a breakout 2025 with over 10x growth and a 75 Net-Promoter-Score. \n\nBeyond the incredible execution and massive opportunity, Jetson hits home personally for me, for 3 big reasons. \n\nFirst, as a fellow University of Waterloo \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Engineer, I\u2019ve seen Stephen, Aaron, and Matthew execute on trailblazing full-stack products for over a decade. They\u2019re an immensely talented, focused, and grounded team who has irreplaceable chemistry and taste.\n\nSecond, from my time founding Kojo and investing in the built environment, I've seen firsthand that the existing value chain of installers, suppliers and manufacturers can only gain so much efficiency with new tech. The Jetson team is working from first-principles and owning everything from the hardware, firmware, consumer facing software, all the way to the crews, trucks and warehouse operations. This end-to-end control allows them to deliver a best-in-class product experience, while also shortening the value chain and passing significant cost savings to the customers.\n\nFinally, in addition to this great team and opportunity, we\u2019re investing alongside some of our favorite people. Alex Kolicich (8VC), Eric Meyer, Caroline C. (Activate Capital), Mike McCauley (Garage Capital), Mike Winterfield (Active Impact Investments) and Garry Tan.\n\nRead all about the investment here: https://lnkd.in/g4MZJS5j\n\nRead Sean Silcoff's coverage in the Globe and Mail: https://lnkd.in/gmGzPx54 \n\nJiten Behl, Michael Laser, Charly M., Lior Susan, Aidan Madigan-Curtis, Greg Reichow, Seth Winterroth, Kaitlyn Glancy, Greg Lyon, Angela Hayward, Laura Spaventa Lewis, Heather Mack, Mary Wells",

And the story gets even better...\n\nI'm excited to announce we've raised a $70M Series B from Khosla Ventures & SoftBank Investment Advisers, with Lightspeed India, Prosus Ventures, Together & Y Combinator participating.\n\nThis matters a lot to me personally. I've watched hundreds of people, including most friends, give up great ideas prematurely because building software felt impossible.\n\nWhen Madhav and I started Emergent, we wanted to give everyone a team of top 1% developers to bring their most audacious ideas to life.\n\nThis raise gets us closer to that ambition. Now, we help builders all over the world do the same.\n\nMillions need to know the time has come to transform their businesses and lives through software. Millions more haven't even realized that it's never been easier to build.\n\nIt's time to take Emergent there.\n\nThe next era of entrepreneurship won't be built with expensive engineers or high dev shop costs. It will be built with Emergent.\n\nWe're the only AI app builder that operates like a team of top engineers, turning ideas into monetizable software.\n\nThe expression of ideas is universally distributed. We only have one ask: Can you describe and express your idea?\n\nThe world is ready for your next big idea to take shape.\n\nStart building now: https://lnkd.in/g8zsavDA\n\n#aicoding #aistartup #startupfunding #vibecoding",

Attach documents, photos, music, video, and files of any kind and we'll transcode it to the most web friendly format and host it for you too. Autopost to facebook, twitter, flickr, and all your blogs.\n\nI ran full stack design and development: from product definition, interaction design, visual design to software engineering, scaling, database management, systems administration. I designed and shipped major parts of the app including text processing, post editor, customizable blog theme engine, embed expansion, realtime and digest email notifications and subscriptions, and bookmarklet. \n\nVaryingly over the years I had to wear all the other hats too -- tech architecture, scaling and optimization, customer support, spam and abuse eradication, branding, PR. It was a blast.\n\nLaunched in July of 2008 and at peak was a Quantcast Top 200 site. We grew 10x in 2009 and 2.5x in 2010. Acquired by Twitter.\n\nPosterous has been hailed in the design community for its focus on no-setup no-signup first time experience, and has been featured in Designing Social Interfaces published by O'Reilly and The Smashing Book by Smashing Magazine. \n\n\"What might be the simplest blogging platform to date.\" --Michael Arrington, Techcrunch\n\n\"In terms of making things really dead simple Posterous beats every other service or app I have ever used. We can learn from them.\" -- Werner Vogels, CTO Amazon\n\n\"The quickest and easiest setup I've ever seen.\" --Huffington Post",
